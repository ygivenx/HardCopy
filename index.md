**Last Updated: December 27, 2025**

## Overview

HardCopy ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our iOS application.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect

HardCopy is designed with privacy in mind. We collect and process:

1. **Camera Data**: When you use the scan feature, the app temporarily processes images from your device's camera to perform optical character recognition (OCR). These images are **never stored, uploaded, or transmitted** to any server.

2. **Local Storage Data**: The app stores the following data **locally on your device only**:
   - Scanned text snippets
   - Source information (book titles, etc.)
   - Tags you assign to snippets
   - Source history (last 10 sources)

### What We Don't Collect

- We do NOT collect any personal information
- We do NOT use analytics or tracking tools
- We do NOT upload your scanned content to any servers
- We do NOT share your data with third parties
- We do NOT use cookies or similar tracking technologies

## How We Use Your Data

All data processing happens **entirely on your device**:

1. **Camera Processing**: Camera frames are processed locally using Apple's Vision framework for text recognition
2. **Storage**: All snippets, sources, and tags are saved using iOS UserDefaults and local JSON files
3. **No Cloud Sync**: Your data never leaves your device

## Data Security

- All data is stored locally on your device using iOS's secure storage mechanisms
- No network requests are made by the app
- No data is transmitted to external servers

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- **Access**: All your data is stored locally and accessible through the app
- **Delete**: You can delete individual snippets or clear all data by deleting the app
- **Export**: You can copy text from the app to use elsewhere

## Children's Privacy

HardCopy does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The app is suitable for all ages.

## Camera Permissions

The app requires camera access to scan text from physical books and documents. You can revoke this permission at any time through your device's Settings app. Without camera access, the scanning feature will not work.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last Updated" date at the top will reflect when changes were made.

## Third-Party Services

HardCopy does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising networks.
